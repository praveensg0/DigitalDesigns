# VLSI Design Project: Full Adder Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of a Full Adder circuit in Verilog, along with test benches for verification. The project demonstrates two approaches: 

1. **Direct Full Adder Implementation**: A straightforward implementation of a Full Adder circuit.
2. **Full Adder Using Half Adders**: An optimized design where a Full Adder is constructed using two Half Adders.

## Folder Structure

- **Full_Adder/**: Contains the Verilog implementation of the Full Adder, its optimized version, and the corresponding test bench.
- **HalfAdder_FullAdder/**: Contains the implementations of the Half Adder and the Full Adder constructed from Half Adders along with the respective test bench.

## Tools Used
- **RTL Design/Verification**: Vivado
- **Synthesis**: Yosys
